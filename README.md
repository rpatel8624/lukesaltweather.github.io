Interface at this Time only in German!

How to use:
Click: Record;
Again Click: Stop Recording and calculate Response!

Take a look on the console, if there are several errors!

Goals:
* add Context and get information out of the spoken sentence 
* [DONE] check for text state even before animating the response.
* improve conversation possibilities (main goal)
* outsource answers to an extra script
* multiple random answers
* randomized Timing (Word appearence)
* [DONE] always use https:// [Github doesn't want to take the htaccess, but technically it's working
* add bilingual system (e.g. samaritan.ai/en or samaritan.ai/de )
